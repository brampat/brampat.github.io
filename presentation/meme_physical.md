-- Notes --

* Desktop backgrounds like this
  * There are so many fun things to do with unlocked & unattended PCs & laptops
  * Prepare your team-mates first
  * Teach your colleagues to always lock
* Uninvited visitors could still visit
* Physical access can lead to digital access

OWASP A09: Security Logging & Monitoring
OWASP C9: Implement Security Logging and Monitoring

* Don't blame people when they fail on Security
  * Help and educate instead
  * See how you can improve on teaching
  * Reward ppl for doing the right thing
* We all have company badges:
  * All employees can check for badges, when company policy is to wear them visibly
  * Be helpful and friendly, malicious ppl will reveal themselves soon enough
  * Spot that "lost visitor" and help them to front-desk for a visitor badge

OWASP A04: Insecure Design
OWASP A06: Vulnerable & Outdated components

* Secure Design is important
  * Perform Secure design review
* This is true with software development as well
  * Think about how your system is going to be used
  * Think how it can be abused
  * Design accordingly
  * Threat modelling
  * Architecture Validation

OWASP SAMM - Design - Security Architecture - ML2: Secure by default design
OWASP SAMM - Design - Security Architecture - Architecture Design ML3: 
* Improve reference architectures based on insights and best practices
OWASP SAMM - Verification - Architecture Assessment - Architecture Validation ML3:
