# The password standoff


## Hypothesis

### Bad passwords
Users have bad passwords

### Bad policies
Systems have bad policies
* 

## How did we get here?
1. We want users to have strong passwords
1. We invent complex policies

1. Users don't like complex

1. Users invent "a system"

   * patterns
     * qwerty
     * P@ssw0rd
     * London19
     * L33tsp34k
   * reuse

## How do we fix this?
1. Kill bad policies
1. Help users with password hygiene
1. Educate users
1. DON'T frustrate users (more than needed)
   * if you can beat em, they won't join you

## What can you do?

### Users
1. Unique
1. Random
1. Long

Only feasible with
1. Photographic memory
1. Password-manager

### Developers
1. Kill your bad policies
1. Proper strength indicators
  * length
  * randomization
  * uniqueness
    * patterns? -> 
      * l33tsp34k
      * London18, 19, 20 etc
      * mypassword@ebay.com
    * reuse? -> PwnedPasswords API
